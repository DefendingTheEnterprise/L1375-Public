## Jordan Drysdale

![](jordan-photo-2.png)

Jordan was around for the inception of Napster and the explosion of P2P networks. This drove his fascination with network systems and led him toward a career in IT. Jordan’s first gig in the industry included supporting Latin American networking customers for Hewlett Packard’s network support division. After five years of support, engineering, training, and stress, Jordan became a wireless escalations team lead and multi-vendor certified problem solver. With kids in tow, Jordan headed back toward the Dakotas to be nearer extended family and friends where he learned Citrix, VMware, VDI, supported Cisco gear, implemented profile management solutions, deployed remote networks at scale, and ensured performance across infrastructure. Before becoming a penetration tester, Jordan supported multiple (50+) domains as part of an MSSP’s rock star team. Solutions included HP Networking, FortiGate/FortiManager/FortiWeb/FortiAnalyzer et al., Cisco ASA, HP DL/GL/ML, Dell, VMware, NetApp, and the list goes on. Since 2015, Jordan has been a penetration tester with the Black Hills InfoSec team.
